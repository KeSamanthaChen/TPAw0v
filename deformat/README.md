# Trace Formatter

The trace stream traverse through various CoreSight component. Sometimes multiple trace sources (e.g. multiple ETMs) would emit stream together. Components such as Embedded Trace Router, Embedded Trace FIFO are able to merge multiple streams into one stream with a format. 

The application here is not used in the work presented. However, it would be helpful for interested people.
